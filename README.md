- Hi, I’m @BrandonConrady
- I’m a student of Data Science at the Associates' level.
- I plan to use this profile in the future for serious projects, but in the meantime, I am going to put silly projects on here as I practice programming.
- You can contact me at brandonwconrady@gmail.com if you need to get a hold of me.
